I had major issues getting my project to build properly.

I tried a lot of different things but the only thing that I could get to work 
was to use the project from the Ch. 13 BitsandPizzas assignment. I completed my app
in that project and got it to work. 

However, it was no longer connected to this GitHub so I did not know how to turn it in.
Long story short, I ended up deleting all of the existing files and importing the files from my assignment.

You should be able to run my app if you download the ZIP and open it in Android Studio. I am not sure
how this compares to how you normally do it but figured I would let you know. 

Thanks,
