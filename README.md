Dr. Layman, 

I was having major issues getting my app to work properly. 

First, I tried to get android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity to work.
Then, I tried to use the androidx libraries with the existing seahawktours code. 
However, I could not get the build error to go away. The only thing that worked was
using the project from the Ch. 13 BitsandPizzas project. Then, I put all of my seahawktours
code in that project. From there, I was able to make my app. The issue was that it was no
longer synced with my GitHub. So, I could not turn it in. The only solution that worked
without any build errors was to delete all of the files in my seahawk-tours repo and to import 
all of the files from my app. 

In conclusion, if you download the ZIP file and open it in Android Studio you should be able to run my app.
I am not sure how you normally run the appbut that is the only thing I could get to work. 

It might not have been the ideal way to do this, but it was the only thing I could get to work. 

Thanks, 
Alex Bolsoy
